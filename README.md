# Tasteology

This project is a technical challenge in which a design was implemented using VueJS. It is fully responsive and includes animations in its interactions.

## Tech stack

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as development framework   
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as css framework   
[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for global state management  
[eslint](https://eslint.org/) as the project's code linter

## Reasoning
### Pinia usage
The copy had to be implemented as if it was populated from a CMS, that is why I used this approach, defining the copies in a global store as if they were being obtained from a remote source.

### Bootstrap usage
I used bootstrap for its simplicity on the grid system and also because it is easier to layout responsive designs with it. Also, its built-in components as the Modal, make development a lot faster.

### Design system
I grouped all the defined meassures in the Figma design and made a minimal design system with it in order to have global styles that could be used in all components
